# Project sfw_login

This is the first of hopefully many Schema Framework development patterns.

This pattern is for an authorized login.  The project includes;

- MySQL scripts for creating a database, some tables and procedures.
- A SRM (Schema Response Mode) file that uses the procedures to
  drive several interactions.
- Scripts to install and uninstall the demo by updating settings,
  configuring Apache for web access, loading MySQL scripts, etc.
